# Euler's Problems
Throughout these challenges, I have gained a better understanding of mathematical concepts and algorithms, and have learned how to apply them to solve complex problems.

Some of the key topics that I have covered include:

-   Prime numbers and their properties
-   The Fibonacci sequence
-   The formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers
-   Arithmetic Progression

I have also had the opportunity to apply these concepts in a variety of real-world scenarios, such as finding the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000, or determining the largest prime factor of a given number.

Overall, these first five Euler questions have provided a great introduction to the world of mathematical problem-solving, and I am excited to continue learning and improving my skills in the next set of challenges
