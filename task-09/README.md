# Crypto Scrapper
For this task we had to use Rust, which I wasn't famaliar with. But as the logic and syntax were kind of similar to other programming languages, coding in rust was not that difficult. However, The difficult part was choosing CSS Selectors as two features had the same selector. Solution to which was using sibling selectors.

I learned a lot about rust and css selector during this task.
