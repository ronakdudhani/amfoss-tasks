This was one of the best task as it was challenging as well as fun at the same time. At the beginning it was quite difficult to get the right logic for the questions but after reading the question properly and analyzing the sample input and output, a simple logic could be formed.

I did encounter some corner cases but working on the logic first rather than thinking about code helped me a lot as I was able to solve those cases quickly.

For this task, I think the logic of the solution was more important the coding first, as if we develop the logic it can reduce the whole quesion into some finite cases which is a lot easier to code than the other way around.

I completed all the questions in HackerRank, and I liked the Monster Slayer the most as it looked difficult at start but after getting the logic that either the first number should be one or all the other number should be multiple of first number for the answer to be Yes, It became quite easy.
