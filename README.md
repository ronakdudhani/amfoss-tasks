## My views about the Tasks
The tasks were fun and designed in such a way that we can learn and ty new things.Some task were challenging but getting the right results were rewarding. Doing the tasks invoked a habit of self-learning and reading for me.
## My Introduction
I am Ronak Agrawal from Kathmandu, Nepal. I like Reading, watching movies, solving questions and exploring new things.

I came to know about amFOSS from from my friends who are already in the club. I feel that the club is one of the best place to learn and I have already seen how my friends have improved. Doing the tasks itself broadend my view and made me learn about alot of new things.
