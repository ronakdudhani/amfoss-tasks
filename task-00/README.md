# Installing Ubuntu
Dual booting is the process of installing multiple operating systems on a single computer, allowing you to choose which one to boot into at startup. This can be useful if you want to use different operating systems for different tasks, or if you want to try out a new operating system without affecting your existing setup.

One of the most popular operating systems to dual boot with is Ubuntu, a popular open-source Linux distribution. In this blog, we will go over the steps for dual booting Ubuntu alongside an existing Windows installation, as well as some common errors that you may encounter and how to fix them.

First, you will need to create a bootable USB drive or DVD with the Ubuntu installation files. You can download these from the Ubuntu website and use a tool like Rufus to create the bootable media.

Once you have the installation media ready, insert it into your computer and restart it. When the boot menu appears, select the option to boot from the USB drive or DVD. This will bring up the Ubuntu installation wizard.

Follow the on-screen instructions to install Ubuntu, making sure to select the option to install it alongside your existing Windows installation. This will create a new partition on your hard drive for Ubuntu, and allow you to choose which operating system to boot into at startup.

One common error that you may encounter during the installation process is a "no root file system is defined" error. This can happen if you didn't create a new partition for Ubuntu, or if the partition was not formatted correctly. To fix this, you can try manually creating a new partition and formatting it as ext4 during the installation process.

Overall, dual booting Ubuntu can be a useful and fun way to try out a new operating system without affecting your existing setup. Just be prepared for some potential errors and know how to fix them if they arise.
