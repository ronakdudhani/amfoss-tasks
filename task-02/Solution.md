# Terminal hunt

Terminal hunt was a fun task to do which helps beginners to get comfortable with **Linux** and **Git** commands in a fun way. Overall this task was quite easy for me as I knew some basic Git and Linux commands.


## Linux Command used:

1. mkdir : To make Solution directory
2. cat or echo : To create first part
3. cp : To copy one file for the actual directory to Solution directory
4. mv : To rename files ( moves files but if you move the file in same dirctory you can rename it)
5. cat : To concatenate multiple files into one file
6. rm : To delete files

## Git Commands used:

1.  git log : To view the commit log
2.  git branch : To view all branches
3.  git checkout : To switch to a specific branch
4.  git merge : To merge two branches

## Git commands that I will use in future tasks:
1.  git add 
2.  git commit
3.  git push e.t.c.
