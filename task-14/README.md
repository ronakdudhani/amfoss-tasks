Throughout these levels, I have learned and implemented several new concepts and techniques. These include:

-   Basic Linux commands such as "ls", "cd", and "cat"
-   File permissions and how to change them using "chmod"
-   Using "grep" to search for specific strings within a file
-   Using "find" to locate files with specific criteria

I also had the opportunity to apply these concepts in a variety of challenges, including finding hidden files and directories, decrypting messages. I am excited to continue learning and improving my skills in the next set of levels.
